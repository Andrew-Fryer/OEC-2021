Possible methods of interactions: 
- Classes
- Switching Classes
- Lunch (more likely if they know the person, i.e. with grades)
- Extra curricular
- Overlap of Teachers
- Overlap of TA's

Number of people:
- 580 students
- 20 teachers
- 5 TAs

Average ages:
- Grade 9 -> 14-15
- Grade 10 -> 15-16
- Grade 11 -> 16-17
- Grade 12 -> 17-18
- TAs -> ~22 -> usually refers to university students either towards post-undergrad or in their late undergrad
- Teachers -> ~43 (in Ontario) -> source: https://www.google.com/search?q=average+age+of+teaching+assistants+high+school+ontario&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA815CA815&oq=average+age+of+teaching+assistants+high+school+ontario&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i333.10087j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

Assumptions:
- TAs are later/post-grad university students
- Measures are in place that will help to minimize the spread of infection (like COVID-19)
    - i.e. mask wearing, social distancing, disinfecting, etc.
- Time of exposure effects the probability of being infected
    - i.e. in class for 45 minutes (relative to exposure) will have a higherly likelihood of leading to other infections than switching between classes
        - Note: this example is only related to time of exposure, it does not account for other variables
- Extra curriculars are outside of normal scheduling but are the length of a period (45 minutes) and do count towards the days work
